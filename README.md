# About this repository

This repository is used to host a SFX file that contains stuff to mine on Netease's cloud gaming service.

Not sure if it's gonna fix the issue with slow download speeds, because so far, I tried to upload this SFX file to Discord and download it from there, but it turns out that in China discordapp.com domains are blocked (the domain that is used to host stuff on Discord is cdn.**discordapp.com**). So I tried to upload it to Dosya.co (a turkish website that allows you to upload files anonymously), but on Netease's service I was getting max. 150 KB/s download speed, while I had even faster download speeds when I downloaded stuff from Dosya on my main network.

So with that, my next place to upload this is GitHub, I checked out that GitHub isn't blocked in China as of now, so there shouldn't be any issues.

Direct download links to SFX executable (both normal and shortened with a link shortener that isn't blocked in China):

Normal: coming soon

Shortened: coming soon
